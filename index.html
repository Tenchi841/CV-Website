			Hello, I am looking to move into software engineering and looking to
			opportunities to bring my experience to the tech industry. I am a highly
			motivated multi-skilled Aircraft Engineer with 10 years of aerospace
			experience on business jet and military aircraft. I have clear communication
			skills, work flexibly as part of a team	but enjoy using my own initiative to
			create solutions. I have great attention to detail, critical thinking
			and analytical skills. I am customer experience conscious and focused on
			satisfying client’s expectations. I’m well-practiced in providing technical
			advice to customers and colleagues including suggesting ideas for
			continuous improvement and lean objectives. I have worked on projects
			in the UK and Overseas and I am comfortable working with
			international colleagues and customers in different time zones. </i>
